                            This webpage allows you to translate multiple Spanish statements at the same time. Makes batch translations much faster and easier. Please note that this is a beta version, and all feedback is welcome.

                            <p>
                                It can be a pain to use special characters (á,é,í,ó,ú,¿,¡,ü,ñ) without a Spanish keyboard. This system accomodates them. To use them here, in any input box, type ~ and then the non-accented version of the character (a,e,i,o,u,?,!,u*,n). For example, "~n" will be converted to "ñ", and "~i" will be converted to "í". *The only exception to this is ü, for which you need to type 2 ~ characters ("~~u" => "ü"). This works on the main textbox, and on all textboxes for editing results in the results section.

                    <ol>
                        <li>Copy the translations to your clipboard <strong><a href="#!" class="btn btn-success" onclick="copyQuizletTranslations()">by clicking here.</a></strong></li>
                        <li>Go to the <a href="https://quizlet.com/create-set">"create a quizlet"</a> page. Click "Import from Word, Excel, Google Docs, etc"</li>
                        <li>Paste the copied text into the "import your data" box. Make sure that the "Between term and definition" setting is set to "Tab", and that the "Between Cards" setting is set to "New Line".</li>
                        <li>Be sure to check over the quizlet before publishing: I can't guarantee that it will find the best translation for every word.</li>
